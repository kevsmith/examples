Many birds are brown, green or grey. These colours make a bird harder to see; they camouflage the bird.
Brown is the most common colour. Brown birds include: sparrows, emus, thrushes, larks, eagles and falcons and 
the female birds of many species such as: wrens, ducks, blackbirds and peafowls. When a brown bird is in long 
grass or among tree trunks or rocks, it is camouflaged. Birds that live in long grass often have brown 
feathers streaked with black which looks like shadows. A bittern is almost invisible in long reeds. Other birds, 
including starlings and minahs, are quite dark in colour, but are flecked with little spots that look like 
raindrops on leaves. Bird may also camouflage their nests.

Many birds from hot countries are green or have some green feathers, particularly parrots. Birds that live in 
green trees often have green backs, even if they have bright-coloured breasts. From the back, the birds are camouflaged. 
This is very useful when sitting on a nest. The bird's bright-coloured breast is hidden. Budgerigars are bred in different 
colours such as blue, white and mauve, but in the wild, they are nearly all green and yellow. Even though they fly very well, 
they normally spend a lot of time on the ground, eating grass seeds. Their yellow and black striped back helps to hide them in 
he shadows made by long dry grass, while their green breasts are a similar colour to the leaves of gum trees.
